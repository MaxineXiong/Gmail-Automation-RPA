This repository hosts a robust automation solution that showcases the seamless integration of the [**UiPath Platform**](https://www.uipath.com/) with the [**Gmail**](https://mail.google.com/). This RPA robot orchestrates **various 
email operations, including Email Reading, Email Saving, Email Attachments Downloading, Email Forwarding, and Email Deletion**, effectively enhancing productivity and organization. 
Additionally, it **generates and sends an automated email summary report** to designated recipient(s), providing insights into the mailing activities that have taken place on each 
target email. With its seamless execution, this automation process demonstrates how UiPath automation can significantly enhance productivity by streamlining email management 
tasks within Gmail accounts.

The final output of this automation solution, an automated email summary report, can be exemplified as shown below:
